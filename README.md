# Thor
Thor is a C++/C# wrapper around the .NET HostFXR library, designed to provide a modern interface for C++/C# interoperability, similar to Mono, but leveraging .NET Core instead of the .NET Framework. The goal of Thor is to offer a streamlined and contemporary API that simplifies the integration between native C++ applications and .NET Core, enhancing usability and performance.
